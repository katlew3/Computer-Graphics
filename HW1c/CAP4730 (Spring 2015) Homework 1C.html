	<h3> Due: Feb 28 11:55pm </h3>
	<h1>Homework 1 Part C</h1> 
	<div class="points">Points: 20 (+5 BONUS)</div>
    <h3> Task 1: Picking and Dragging </h3>
    <img class="side" src="./CAP4730 (Spring 2015) Homework 1C_files/hw1c-1.jpg">
    <div class="points">Points: 5</div>
    <p>
      Use picking and dragging method from part A of the homework to move control points
      of the spline curve (the one from Task2 of HW1 B). The spline curve should be updated when the control points are
      being moved. You should also implement movement in the <strong>Z</strong> direction. 
      If the user clicks on a point and moves the mouse while holding the <span class="key">shift</span>
      key on the keyboard, vertical movement of the mouse should be mapped to movement of
      the point along <strong>Z</strong> axis.
    </p>
    <h3> Task 2: Side view </h3>
    <img class="side" src="./CAP4730 (Spring 2015) Homework 1C_files/hw1c-2.jpg">
    <div class="points">Points: 10</div>
    <p>
      In the top half of the window draw the  default view perpendicular to the x-y plane. 
      In the bottom half 
      of the window draw the side view perpendicular to y-z plane.
    </p><p> This method should be activated when key <span class="key">4</span> is pressed on the keyboard</p>
    <p></p>
	<h3> Task 3: Answer the Question </h3>
    <div class="points">Points: 5</div>
    <p> In HW1 B you had to draw 3 curves. Is any of them an exact circle (possibly in the limit for task 1)? <br>
	Justify your answer and put it in a <strong>ReadMe.txt</strong> file along with the rest of your submission
	</p>
	
    <h3> Bonus </h3>
    <img class="side" src="./CAP4730 (Spring 2015) Homework 1C_files/hw1c-3.jpg">
    <div class="points">Points: 5</div>
    <p>
      Create a yellow dot moving along the curve. 
    </p>
    <p> This method should be activated when key <span class="key">5</span> is pressed on the keyboard</p>

	<h3> WHAT TO SUBMIT </h3>
		<ul>
			<li> A .ZIP ARCHIVE CONTAINING:
			<ul><li> All of your <strong>source</strong> files (.cpp's, shaders, etc) as in <a href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mgsarov/class/cap4730sp15/hw1/hw1b_sp15_codebase.zip">link</a></li>
				<li> The <strong>ReadMe</strong> file mentioned above.</li>
				<li> <strong>Screenshots</strong> of your running program: one per task. </li>
			</ul></li>
			<i>NOTE: Make sure your programs compile and run on the lab machines in E313 as the grading would be done on them.</i>
		</ul>
