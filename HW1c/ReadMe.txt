None of the curves are exact circles. 
DeCastau may actually come close to looking like a circle but this is misleading to the viewer.


- A circle is the set of all points equidistant from some center
- The complete and infinite set cannot be completely described by 
discrete methods such as deCasteljau's nor drawn with a finite number of pixels. 

- if the polynomial points are equal AND their derivatives at that point are equal then they connect
- Therefore the circle is made up of many line segments (hence the line loop)
- If the polynomial values equal each and the line segments will connect
- If you wanted an exact circle you'd need infinite amount of points, thus there will always be segmentation
- It would be impossible to make a true circle with solely line segments
